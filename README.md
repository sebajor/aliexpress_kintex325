To build the projects you need to add to the vivado to the PATH

## TODO

- [ ] Complete the xdc file
- [ ] Board files
- [x] Automatic building using vivado in batch mode
- [x] Recheck the uart cores--> the loopback freeze sometimes (I havent look that behaviour in other boards, but is likely to be buggy)
- [ ] DRAM model
- [ ] Gbe model
- [ ] 10Gbe model
- [x] HDMI model 
- [ ] SATA model
- [ ] PCIe model
- [ ] HPC LPC model test
