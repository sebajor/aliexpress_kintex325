To build the projects you need to add to the vivado to the PATH

## TODO

- [] Complete the xdc file
- [] Board files
- [x] Automatic building using vivado non-project mode
- [] Recheck the uart cores--> the loopback freeze sometimes (I havent look that behaviour in other boards, but is likely to be buggy)
- [] DRAM model
- [] Gbe model
- [] 10Gbe model
- [] HDMI model 
- [] SATA model
- [] PCIe model
- [] HPC LPC model test
